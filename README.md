# Autonomous-Lawyering

WACEO is a non-profit association providing advisory and support services for DAOs and blockchain projects. At WACEO, we believe that crypto is a global phenomenon and requires a broad and collaborative approach. DeFiâ€™s borderless nature requires the understanding of multiple jurisdictions, and the European Union is an important and fast-maturing jurisdiction to consider. With regulations such as the incoming Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation and the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive 5, it is imperative that protocols and blockchain projects are equipped with the knowledge and know-how of how these laws apply to their activities. 

While other players may support in different jurisdictions of law and regulation, we believe that WACEO has the experience and expertise to support both the legal and governance structuring of blockchain projects from an EU and wider international perspective.

Our team of service providers is composed of DeFi and Crypto Experts who have been researching, working, and building in the blockchain sphere for years. The team includes:

- field experts who have built blockchain projects for almost half a decade;
- legal professionals with expertise in cutting edge digital fields; and
- lobbyists who have direct lines of communication with regulators.

In the provision of our legal and governance advisory role to DAOs and blockchain projects, we support a number of services such as audits, supervision and training.
